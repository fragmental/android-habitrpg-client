android-habitrpg-client
=======================

Unofficial HabitRPG native Android Client with Widget

# Build

The client depends on Android_PaintBox

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:uvwxy/paintbox.git Android_PaintBox
```

Add this library to your Eclipse workspace and refresh your project. It should find the referenced project (Check it under "Project" -> Preferences -> Android -> "Libraries")

# Old Repo

The old repository is [here](https://bitbucket.org/uvwxy/android-habitrpg-client/).
I moved it to github due to the following [request}(https://bitbucket.org/uvwxy/android-habitrpg-client/issue/8/thinking-of-forking-updating-to-apiv2-and)
and I also assume it might get more attention on GitHub.
